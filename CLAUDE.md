Whenever building new code, try to reuse as much code as possible. If the new functionality overlaps heavily with other parts of the code, find a way to abstract and reuse the logic instead of duplicating the functionality.

Always keep the CLAUDE.md file up to date to reflect the current functionality and architecture of the code.

## Experiment config: Hydra is the sole path (`conf/` + `train.py`)

Runs are launched **only** through the Hydra entry point `train.py`. The legacy
yaml loader (`run_algorithm` in `algorithms/algorithms.py`) and its argparse CLI
(`run_trial.py`) have been **retired** — the `experiments/yamls/<batch>/` files
remain on disk as source material to migrate into `conf/`, but nothing loads them
at runtime any more.

`train.py` composes a run from orthogonal groups (**algorithm × env × model ×
seeds**), resolves it, and hands the result to the shared dispatch tail
`_dispatch(algorithm, exp_dict, env_config, batch_dir, results_dir, trial_id,
...)` in `algorithms/algorithms.py`. `_dispatch` builds the per-algo
`Experiment(**exp_dict)` → constructs the Runner → `train()`/`view()`/
`evaluate()`. `batch_dir` (`experiments/yamls/<batch>`) is only used by runners
for `combined_affinities` checkpoint resolution (`batch_dir.parents[1]/results`);
`results_dir` is the runner's `trials_dir` (`results/<batch>/<name>`).

- `conf/config.yaml` — defaults list (`algorithm: mappo`, `env: ...`, `model:
  ...`, `seeds: standard`, `_self_`) + top-level `device`/`trial_id`/`view`/
  `checkpoint`/`evaluate`. Group order sets precedence (later wins): algorithm
  supplies base `params`/`model_params`; env overrides env-scoped `params`
  (`val_coef`, `n_total_steps`) and publishes a `hyperedges` map; model overrides
  `model_params`; seeds injects `params.random_seeds`. `hydra.job.chdir=false` +
  `output_subdir=null` + null log handlers keep cwd/paths/results untouched.
- `conf/algorithm/{mappo,...}.yaml`, `conf/env/<batch>.yaml`,
  `conf/model/<variant>.yaml`, `conf/seeds/{standard,...}.yaml`. **Env/model
  filenames equal the old batch/variant names** so `results/<batch>/<name>/
  <trial_id>/` and existing checkpoints resolve. Model files hold only the
  `model_params` delta (env-specific `hyperedge_fn_names` interpolate the env's
  map, e.g. `${hyperedges.mix}`), mirroring the legacy variant's keys exactly.
- `train.py` — `@hydra.main`; `OmegaConf.to_container(resolve=True)` →
  `_build_dispatch_args(cfg, choices)` → `_dispatch`. `choices` (env/model) come
  from `HydraConfig.get().runtime.choices` and preserve the output layout.
  Run: `uv run python train.py env=multi_box_push_9a_3o model=hgnn_mix trial_id=0`;
  sweep: `uv run python train.py -m model=mlp_shared,gnn_critic trial_id=0,1,2`
  (add `hydra/launcher=joblib_auto` for local parallelism).
- **Parallelism autoscaling (two nested layers).** Layer 1 is the sweep: with
  the joblib launcher each cross-product job runs in its own loky worker. Layer 2
  is per-job rollout collection: `make_vec_env` forks `env.n_envs` box2d
  subprocesses. The two multiply, so the budget is `n_jobs × n_envs ≲ cores`.
  A single top-level knob `n_jobs` (in `conf/config.yaml`, default `1`) drives
  both: `conf/config.yaml`'s `_self_` block sets `env.n_envs:
  ${envs_per_job:${n_jobs}}` → `usable_cores // n_jobs` **centrally** for every
  env group (it wins over the selected `conf/env/*` because `_self_` is last;
  pin a fixed count on the CLI with `env.n_envs=<N>`), and the
  `hydra/launcher=joblib_auto` group
  (`conf/hydra/launcher/joblib_auto.yaml`, wraps the plugin's `joblib` and sets
  `n_jobs: ${n_jobs}`) makes joblib run that many at once. Resolvers `cores` /
  `envs_per_job` are registered at `train.py` import; `_usable_cores()` reads the
  CPU-affinity mask (`os.sched_getaffinity`) so it respects `taskset` / cgroup /
  SLURM quotas. So `n_jobs=1` (default) → one run using all cores for envs;
  `-m ... n_jobs=4 hydra/launcher=joblib_auto` → 4 concurrent jobs × `cores//4`
  envs each. Override `env.n_envs=<N>` on the CLI to opt out of autoscaling.
  **Fork context is pinned** in `make_vec_env` (`context="fork"` for non-HRL,
  `"forkserver"` for HRL) rather than the ambient default: inside a loky worker
  the default start method is `"loky"` (spawn-like), which forces
  `AsyncVectorEnv` to pickle its `shared_memory` buffers and crashes with
  `cannot pickle 'mmap.mmap'`. `Runner.__init__` floors torch threads at
  `max(1, get_num_threads()//2)` since a loky worker can start with 1 thread.
- **Migration status:** `multi_box_push_9a_3o` (MAPPO) and `dcg_smaclite_2s3z`
  (DCG) are currently ported into `conf/`. Other batches under
  `experiments/yamls/` must be migrated to `conf/env` + `conf/model` before they
  can run. To add a batch: create `conf/env/<batch>.yaml` (from `_batch.yaml`'s
  `env:` block + `params` overrides + `hyperedges` map) and one
  `conf/model/<variant>.yaml` per experiment yaml (the `model_params` delta); the
  env/model filenames must equal the old batch/variant names to preserve the
  `results/<batch>/<name>` layout. The DCG port also added
  `conf/algorithm/dcg.yaml` (the `params` block); DCG's env group must expose
  `environment`/`n_agents`/`env_variant` under `env:` (the trainer reads
  `env_params.get("environment")`, not `name`), and the default `seeds: standard`
  list already matches the old DCG seed list for `trial_id` indexing. Non-box2d
  batches (smac, dcg, ippo/jax) may also need `vec_trainer`
  `self.env_name`/`self.env_variant` wiring. The convenience wrappers `train.sh` /
  `scripts/evaluate.sh` translate `(BATCH, ALGORITHM, ENVIRONMENT, TRIAL_ID,
  EXP_NAME)` positional args into Hydra overrides (`env=$BATCH model=$EXP_NAME
  algorithm=$ALGORITHM ...`); `$ENVIRONMENT` is vestigial. The `scripts/hpc/*`
  launchers still reference the removed `run_trial.py` and must be updated to
  `train.py` before use.

## Box2D suite observations

All `environments/box2d_suite` envs share `ObservationManager.get_observation`
(in `observation.py`). The per-agent observation vector is, in order:

- `own_velocity` (2) — linear velocity normalized by `velocity_norm`
- `density_sensors` (16) — 8-sector centroid distance to agents (0-7) and objects (8-15)
- `is_touching_object` (1)
- `neighbor_fraction` (1) — fraction of agents within `neighbor_detection_range` (incl. self)
- `contact_force` (1) — per-agent contact force / `force_multiplier`
- `nearest_box_vec` (2) — relative (dx, dy) to the nearest object, per axis
  normalized by `world_width`; zero vector when the env has no objects.
  Egocentric (no absolute world anchor).
- `goal_distance` (1) — signed relative distance from the agent to the target
  region center, measured along the env's **goal axis**: the y axis by default
  (normalized by `world_height`), or the x axis (normalized by `world_width`)
  when the env sets `goal_axis == "x"` (read via `getattr`, default `"y"`). 0
  when the env has no `target_areas`. Egocentric goal-grounding for the
  box-push/grab tasks; `push_box` uses the x axis when its goal band is on the
  left/right wall.
- `lidar` (`N_LIDAR_RAYS`, default 16) — nearest-obstacle distance along evenly
  spaced world-frame rays via Box2D raycast; normalized to [0, 1], 1.0 == clear

Note: absolute `own_pos` is intentionally **not** in the vector — the
observation is egocentric. `nearest_box_vec` + `goal_distance` restore goal
grounding (where to push, and how far) without reintroducing an absolute
world-frame anchor.

### Sensor overlay (debug rendering)

`Renderer._draw_sensor_overlay` (`renderer.py`) draws the observation of **one
focus agent** on top of the world: the 8+8 density sectors (`A:` agents / `O:`
objects), the lidar scan (rays to their hit points, red dot on a hit, faint when
clear), a magenta `nearest_box_vec` arrow, a green `goal_distance` segment along
the env's goal axis, and a HUD legend with the scalar values. The focus agent is
`env.render_sensor_agent` (default 0) — drawing every agent is unreadable past a
handful, and costs a raycast pass per agent per frame.

Values come from `ObservationManager.get_sensor_readout(agent_idx)`, which calls
the **same** `_calculate_*` paths as `get_observation` (verified equal to the
corresponding obs slices), so the overlay cannot drift from what the policy sees.
`get_sensor_readout` calls `_refresh_caches()` itself, so it is safe outside a
`get_observation` step. The lidar scan is factored into a per-agent
`_calculate_lidar` (`_calculate_lidar_all` loops it) so the overlay raycasts only
the focus agent, and `ObservationManager.lidar_directions` is shared by the scan
and the drawing. Envs with no `objects` / no `target_areas` (scatter,
rendezvouz) simply skip the box/goal arrows. The old scalar
`calculate_density_sensors` — a duplicate of the vectorized math, used only by
the renderer — was deleted.

The total dimension is exported as `OBS_DIM` (= `BASE_OBS_DIM + N_LIDAR_RAYS`) from
`observation.py`; every env's `observation_space` must use `OBS_DIM` so the layout
stays in sync. Per-env overrides `n_lidar_rays` / `lidar_range` are read via
`getattr` (defaults: `N_LIDAR_RAYS`, `sector_sensor_radius`).

## Push-box environment (`push_box.py`)

`PushBoxEnv` (`EnvironmentEnum.PUSH_TO_TOP` case, key `"push_box"`) is a
single-box cooperative pushing task built by reusing the `multi_box_push`
machinery (boundary, observation, renderer, contact listener, target band).

- **Variable goal wall.** Each episode `reset` samples one of the four walls
  (`_GOAL_SIDES`: top/bottom/left/right) and sets `self.goal_side`,
  `self.goal_axis` (`"x"`/`"y"`), and `self.goal_sign` (+1 toward the high end
  of that axis). `_create_target_areas` builds the band spanning that wall
  (full inner length, `band`-thick). `__init__` defaults to `"top"` so a valid
  target/observation exists before the first reset.
- **Spawn layout (band → box → agents).** `reset` builds the goal band first,
  then the box, then the agents, so each step can reference the previous. Both
  the box and every agent start at least `self.min_goal_spawn_distance` from the
  goal band along the goal axis (= `_MIN_GOAL_SPAWN_FRACTION` (0.4) × world
  extent; the world is square). The shared line is
  `_goal_axis_spawn_limit()` — the goal-axis coordinate exactly that far from
  the band's inner edge.
  - `_create_dynamic_objects` places the box **at** that line (goal axis) with a
    randomized perpendicular coordinate, independent of the agents — so it never
    starts inside the band (no instant delivery) and is far from the goal.
  - `_scatter_agent_positions` scatters agents on the **far side** of that line
    (away from the goal), spaced `min_sep` apart, rejecting any sample that
    would overlap the box (`_overlaps_box`, a disc-vs-rect test using
    `_AGENT_RADIUS`). Uses the seeded `np_random`; falls back to an even spread
    if rejection sampling fails. Replaces the old `get_scatter_positions` call,
    which ignored the goal side and clustered agents in the bottom third.
- Box size **varies per episode**: square half-extent sampled uniformly in
  `[1.5, 1.8]` (1.5 is the minimum, +20%) via the seeded `np_random`.
- **Coupling mechanic** (shared `utils.update_object_mass_from_contacts`): the
  box's `userData["coupling"]` is `n_agents`. Base density `20.0` keeps it
  nearly immovable until **all** agents are touching it; once the requirement is
  met density drops to `0.05 * coupling`, making it far lighter. Same helper now
  used by `multi_box_push`.
- Reward (`_calculate_goal_push_reward`) is the **per-step displacement of the
  box toward the goal wall** (`(box_coord - prev_box_coord) * goal_sign`, where
  `box_coord` is the box's position on `goal_axis`), plus a one-time `+100`
  completion bonus that terminates the episode when the box enters the band.
  `reward_mode="dense"` keeps the shaping term; `"sparse"` pays only the bonus.
- Wired into `algorithms/create_env.py` `make_vec_env` (reads `reward_mode` from
  `env_params`). Run the manual debugger with
  `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy python -m environments.box2d_suite.push_box`.

## MJX suite

### Shared observations (`environments/mjx_suite/observation.py`)

`MJXObservationBuilder` is the JAX counterpart of the Box2D suite's
`ObservationManager`: it owns the sensor math and the 40-dim `OBS_DIM` layout
for **every** MJX port, so a new port only supplies its own qpos layout and
goal. Pure and `jit`/`vmap`-able; the env passes plain arrays (agent positions/
velocities, box poses) plus the `mjx.Data` (needed for lidar raycasts and the
efc contact-force decode).

- Construct with the `mjx.Model` + world/normalization constants
  (`world_width/height`, `velocity_norm`, `neighbor_detection_range`,
  `agent_radius`, `force_multiplier`; `sector_sensor_radius` defaults to
  `world_width/3` and `lidar_range` to the sector radius, as in Box2D). Contact
  attribution needs the geom→entity maps from the helper `geom_index_maps(mj_model,
  n_agents, n_objects)` (naming convention `g_agent_{i}` / `g_box_{j}`).
- `build(data, agent_pos, agent_vel, box_pos=, box_yaw=, box_half=,
  goal_coord=, goal_axis=)` returns `(A, OBS_DIM)`; the components are also
  exposed individually (`touch_matrix`, `density_sensors`, `neighbor_fractions`,
  `pairwise_agent_distances`, `nearest_box_vectors`, `goal_distances`, `lidar`,
  `contact_forces`) — `_touch_matrix` (coupling) and the renderer reuse them.
- **Generalizes past multi_box_push**, mirroring the Box2D fallbacks: `n_objects=0`
  (scatter/rendezvouz) zeros the object density block, `is_touching_object`,
  `nearest_box_vec` and the contact force; `goal_coord=None` (contact/scatter/
  rendezvouz have no `target_areas`) zeros `goal_distance`; and `goal_axis`
  takes a **traced** axis index (0=x, 1=y) as well as the static `"x"`/`"y"`,
  so push_box's per-episode goal wall stays jit/vmap-able.
- Verified bit-identical to the pre-extraction inline implementation across a
  150-step rollout, all 40 dims. Note when checking such things: MJX rollouts
  are **not reproducible across processes** (`mjx.ray` differs ~3e-4 run to run,
  which chaos amplifies) — compare both implementations on the *same* states in
  one process instead.

### MJX multi-box-push (`environments/mjx_suite/multi_box_push_mjx.py`)

`MultiBoxPushMJX` is a MuJoCo-MJX port of the Box2D `multi_box_push` env with a
functional, fully `jit`/`vmap`-able gymnax-style API: `reset(key) -> (obs,
EnvState)`, `step(state, actions) -> (obs, state, reward, terminated,
truncated, info)`; no auto-reset (caller's job). `EnvState` is a registered
dataclass holding `mjx.Data` + step counter + per-box `prev_box_goal_dist` /
`delivered`.

- **2D by construction.** Bodies own only planar DOFs (agents: slide-x/y;
  boxes: slide-x/y + hinge-yaw), gravity is zero, walls are four inward-facing
  planes — there is no z DOF, so MJX never computes out-of-plane dynamics.
  Options: `integrator="implicitfast"` (implicit joint damping — the same
  semantics as Box2D's `v /= 1 + d*dt`) and the default **pyramidal** friction
  cone (elliptic NaNs out on GPU/f32 when a light coupled box is crushed
  against a wall by many agents).
- **Parity with Box2D.** Same world sizing, spawn regions, coupling list, box
  sizing, target band, reward (shaping + one-time +100/box, dense/sparse),
  boundary-contact termination, and the exact 40-dim `OBS_DIM` observation
  layout (built by the shared `MJXObservationBuilder` above). Verified by
  posing both engines identically and diffing all 40 dims: everything equal to
  f32 precision, lidar within 4e-4. Box2D damping/mass constants are emulated
  with joint damping = coeff × mass (× inertia for the hinge).
- **Coupling mechanic** is a per-step override of `body_mass` / `body_inertia`
  / `dof_damping` on the `mjx.Model` pytree (`_model_for`) — jit-safe because
  the model is an argument to `mjx.step`. Touch detection is the same
  rotated-box surface-distance test as Box2D's. `_model_for(data, active=None)`
  takes an optional traced (A,) mask of *cooperating* agents; masked agents are
  dropped from the touch count (used by the difference-reward counterfactual).
- **`reward_mode="difference_rewards"`** makes `step` return a **(n_agents,)**
  per-agent reward instead of the team scalar: the exact single-step difference
  reward `D_i = G - G_-i`, from forking the pre-step state once per agent
  (`_difference_rewards`, vmapped) and re-running the same step with agent i
  contributing nothing — zero force *and* dropped from the coupling count.
  `info["task_reward"]` still carries the team scalar in **every** mode, so
  logging/eval stay comparable. The team reward is shaped exactly as `"dense"`
  (a sparse base would leave D zero except on delivery steps). `step` is
  factored into `_advance` (physics) + `_task_reward` (pure in
  `(state, data)`), so counterfactual branches reuse both with no recursion.
  Costs A extra `mjx.step` calls, but they vmap onto spare GPU: measured **1.17x**
  wall-clock (332 -> 284 FPS at 9a/3o, n_envs=8), not the ~9x the step count
  suggests.
  - **Known property, important before using it:** single-step D is *additive
    force attribution*, not coalition credit — `sum_i D_i / G ~ 1.1`. Box mass
    affects acceleration, not instantaneous velocity, so a heavy box still
    coasts and one step cannot reveal the coupling mechanic. The coalition
    structure (each of the 3 required agents individually necessary, so
    `sum_i D_i / G -> ~3.2`) only appears at counterfactual windows of **n >= 30**
    steps (measured: n=1 -> 1.12, n=15 -> 2.41, n=30 -> 3.26, n=60 -> 3.22,
    saturating at the coupling number). A windowed counterfactual costs the
    *same* compute when amortized (A*K extra steps per K steps == A per step)
    but must roll forward with the **policy**, so it belongs in the trainer, not
    the env. Single-step D is still a legitimate learnability signal (agent i's
    gradient stops being polluted by teammates' noise).
- **Sensors in JAX**: density sectors / neighbor fraction / nearest-box /
  goal distance are direct jnp ports; lidar is one vmapped `mjx.ray` call with
  ray origins offset just past the caster's own surface (`bodyexclude` is
  static numpy inside mjx, so self-exclusion can't be traced); per-agent
  contact normal force = sum of the 4 pyramidal facet rows at each contact's
  `efc_address` (verified ≈100 N steady-state for a 100 N push). A dummy
  `<material>` asset works around an mjx.ray crash on material-less models.
- Spawns use shuffled jittered grids (same regions/min separations as the
  Box2D rejection sampling — jit needs static shapes). Reward shaping is live
  from step 1 (Box2D pays 0 on its first step); box sizes fixed per instance
  (as in Box2D). `info` carries `adjacency`, `agents_2_objects` as a dense
  (O, A) 0/1 matrix, positions, `delivered`.
- **Renderer** (`environments/mjx_suite/renderer.py`): the env stays pure JAX;
  `MJXRenderer(env)` is a host-side subclass of the Box2D suite `Renderer`
  that consumes an `EnvState` — it inherits the walls / target-band / sensor-
  overlay drawing (the env exposes a real `ObjectTargetArea`; a
  `SimpleNamespace` shim supplies `observation_manager.lidar_directions`) and
  reimplements only the body drawing from a numpy snapshot. `render(state,
  obs=obs, focus_agent=i)` returns an (H, W, 3) uint8 frame in the default
  `rgb_array` mode (headless-safe) or draws to a window with `mode="human"`;
  the overlay is sliced from the actual observation vector. Extras over
  Box2D: green outline + live `touching/coupling` counter on each box,
  delivered boxes washed out. `save_video(frames, "out.mp4"|".gif")` via
  imageio. Vmapped states: index one env with `jax.tree.map(lambda x: x[i],
  state)`. The same module also has `MuJoCoNativeRenderer(env, camera="iso"|
  "top")` — native MuJoCo OpenGL rendering via `mujoco.Renderer` against a
  cosmetic **visual twin** model (`env._build_xml(..., visual=True)`: same
  bodies/joints so the MJX qpos copies straight into a host `MjData` +
  `mj_forward`; adds contype-0 floor/walls/target-band/skybox/light, never
  stepped). Coupled boxes tint green, delivered fade translucent. Needs
  `MUJOCO_GL=egl` headless. Demo (writes mp4 + png, scripted delivery via the
  shared `scripted_push_action`): `MUJOCO_GL=egl SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy uv run
  python -m environments.mjx_suite.renderer [--native iso|top]`.
- Demo/sanity check (scripted delivery rollout + vmapped throughput):
  `uv run python -m environments.mjx_suite.multi_box_push_mjx`. Step-matched
  wall-clock shootout vs Box2D (`profile_multi_box_push.py`, Box2D on all
  cores via AsyncVectorEnv, MJX vmapped on GPU): at 30a/6o, 100 eps x 1024
  steps, MJX 15.0s (6.8k steps/s) vs Box2D 56.5s (1.8k steps/s) — 3.8x, plus
  a one-time ~7s MJX compile. Not wired into `create_env` (torch MAPPO gains
  nothing from it), but it **is** the training env of the fully-jitted
  `mappo_jax` stack (below) via `EnvironmentEnum.MULTI_BOX_MJX =
  "multi_box_push_mjx"`.

## JAX MAPPO (`algorithms/mappo_jax/`)

`algorithm=mappo_jax` (`AlgorithmEnum.MAPPO_JAX`) is a fully-jitted MAPPO that
trains **directly on the functional MJX env** (`MultiBoxPushMJX` — the only
supported env; the old JaxMARL dict-API path was removed). It is a deliberate
logic mirror of `mappo_vanilla` so runs are drop-in comparable:

- **Same per-iteration cadence** (`run.py` ≙ `VecMAPPOTrainer.train`): jitted
  `collect_fn` (≙ `RolloutCollector.collect` — resets all envs at the top of
  every rollout, scans `params.n_steps` (the per-update batch is `n_steps *
  n_envs` env-steps in both stacks, scaling with parallelism), restarts envs that
  finish mid-rollout since MJX has no auto-reset, bootstraps the final value) →
  jitted `update_fn` (≙ `MAPPOAgent.update`) → jitted deterministic `eval_fn`
  (≙ `PolicyEvaluator`, 5 parallel episodes → the `reward` stat). Deviation:
  eval runs every 10 updates (+ the last), not every iteration — it scans a
  full `env.max_steps` sequentially, which would dominate wall-clock — and the
  `reward` stat carries the last eval forward in between.
- **Same PPO update semantics** (`mappo.py`): env-level GAE on the scalar team
  reward with the shared critic (vanilla tiles it per agent — identical math),
  per-env-stream advantage normalization (unbiased std), timestep-centric
  minibatches (`(batch // n_minibatches) // n_agents` timesteps each, critic
  once per timestep), combined loss `policy + val_coef*value +
  ent_coef*entropy` (actor/critic use separate Adams — equivalent, no shared
  params), pre-update `explained_variance`. Known deviations: the trailing
  partial minibatch is dropped (jit needs static shapes), shared-actor only
  (`parameter_sharing=false` raises), continuous actions only in practice.
- **Same networks** (`network.py`, flax): 2-layer Tanh MLPs with the same
  orthogonal init, actor hidden = `model_params.hidden_dim`, critic hidden =
  `2*hidden_dim`, learned state-independent `log_action_std` (init -0.5, clamp
  [-5, 2]). Distributions are hand-rolled diagonal-Gaussian/categorical
  (no distrax; `flax`+`optax` are deps, `distrax`/`chex`/`jaxmarl` are not).
- **Same outputs**: reuses `TrainingStatsTracker`, writing
  `training_stats_{checkpoint,finished}.pkl` with the exact vanilla key set
  (plotting notebooks read them unchanged) under `results/<env>/<model>/
  <trial_id>/logs`. Params are flax msgpack (`models_{checkpoint,finished}
  .msgpack`), not torch `.pth`. **Checkpoint resume works** (`checkpoint=true`):
  the stats checkpoint restores the progress counters (vanilla flow) and
  `models/train_checkpoint.msgpack` restores the full training state — actor/
  critic params, optimizer states, step counters, and both RNG chains — saved
  at every log point *and* at finish, so re-running with a larger
  `n_total_steps` extends a finished run. (`load_from_dict` in the shared
  `TrainingStatsTracker` now also restores the agent-loss series, so resumed
  stats stay index-aligned — this fixed a latent vanilla resume flaw too.)
  `view()` renders 10 deterministic episodes via `MJXRenderer`
  (video + reward plot, like vanilla) and, when a GL context is available
  (`MUJOCO_GL=egl` headless), also saves a `MuJoCoNativeRenderer` video per
  episode (`episode_<i>_native.mp4`); `evaluate()` prints the mean eval return.
- **Per-agent rewards / difference rewards.** When the env's
  `reward_mode="difference_rewards"` (env group `multi_box_push_mjx_9a_3o_dr`),
  `run.py` sets `MAPPOConfig.per_agent_rewards=True` and the stack switches to a
  per-agent credit path; otherwise **nothing changes** (the scalar path is
  byte-for-byte the original). What the flag switches:
  `Transition.reward` `(n_envs,)` -> `(n_envs, n_agents)` and `value` likewise;
  `MAPPOCritic(n_outputs=n_agents)` grows a **per-agent value head** (one value
  per agent off the same global state — each agent now has its own return to
  predict); `compute_gae` broadcasts `done` over a trailing agent axis and runs
  the identical recursion per agent (verified: feeding per-agent rewards that are
  identical reproduces the team result exactly); the minibatch advantage stops
  being `jnp.repeat`'d from the env level and is taken per agent. Advantage
  normalization then becomes per-(env, agent) — which is exactly what vanilla
  does. `Transition.team_reward` (`info["task_reward"]`) is carried purely for
  logging so `mean_reward`, `eval_fn` and `view()` always report **team**
  performance and stay comparable to the dense baseline. Stats keys are
  unchanged, so the plotting notebooks read either arm.
- **Config**: `conf/algorithm/mappo_jax.yaml` (same params surface as
  `mappo_vanilla`), `conf/env/multi_box_push_mjx_9a_3o.yaml` (dense team reward)
  and `conf/env/multi_box_push_mjx_9a_3o_dr.yaml` (difference rewards), model
  group `mlp` (plain `hidden_dim`; `mlp_shared` carries full-MAPPO keys like
  `critic_type` that `Model_Params` rejects). The central `env.n_envs` autoscale

## Coordination-graph novelty exploration (gnn critic)

When `critic_type="gnn"`, the `AttentionGNNCritic` (`networks/gnn_critic.py`)
emits a per-head coordination graph from its attention encoder. Setting
`use_intrinsic_reward=True` (in `Model_Params`) turns that graph into an
exploration bonus: agents are rewarded for reaching states whose **coordination
graph is novel** within the current episode.

- The encoder is **dual-purpose** — shared with the value path and trained by the
  value loss, so the graph is grounded. The bonus reads it under `no_grad` via
  `network_old` (`MAPPOAgent.compute_coordination_features`).
- Descriptor (`AttentionGNNCritic.coordination_descriptor`, exposed via
  `MAPPONetwork.coordination_descriptor`):
  - `intrinsic_reward_mode="team"` → upper-triangle of each head's adjacency,
    one bonus per env tiled to all agents.
  - `intrinsic_reward_mode="agent"` → each agent's coordination row across heads,
    a per-agent bonus.
  - `intrinsic_descriptor_source` is `"adjacency"` (symmetric graph structure,
    default), `"directed_adjacency"` (raw directed attention scores — keeps the
    who-attends-to-whom asymmetry that symmetrization discards; team = all
    off-diagonal entries per head, agent = outgoing row + incoming column per
    agent), or `"node_embedding"` (attended tokens) for ablation. The directed
    scores are exposed by `MultiHeadAttentionEncoder.forward(..., return_scores=True)`;
    averaging the two directed halves recovers the symmetric descriptor exactly.
- Novelty is episodic k-NN distance (`intrinsic_reward.py`,
  `BatchedIntrinsicReward`). One batched rewarder scores all streams at once —
  one stream per env (`team`) or per (env, agent) (`agent`) — using a
  preallocated ring buffer `(n_streams, capacity, feat_dim)` and a single
  `cdist`/`sort`, instead of a per-stream deque that restacked its full memory
  every step (quadratic in episode length). Streams reset on episode done.
  Reward is `log(d_k + 1)` for the `min(k, count)`-th nearest stored point;
  empty-memory/done streams score 0. Plumbed in `RolloutCollector`
  (`_get_team_intrinsic_rewards` / `_get_agent_intrinsic_rewards`) and folded into
  per-agent rewards in `MAPPOAgent.store_transitions_batch` (single-stream, scaled
  by `intrinsic_reward_coef`).
- Config knobs in `Model_Params`: `intrinsic_reward_coef`, `intrinsic_reward_k`,
  `intrinsic_reward_memory_capacity`. Asserts `critic_type=="gnn"`; fully inert
  when `use_intrinsic_reward=False`.
- Logging: `RolloutCollector.collect` returns per-rollout means
  `mean_intrinsic_reward` (coef-scaled bonus exactly as it enters the agents'
  reward; 0 when intrinsic is off) and `mean_extrinsic_reward` (raw env reward
  over the same steps) on `RolloutResult`. `vec_trainer` records these into
  `training_stats["intrinsic_reward"]` / `["extrinsic_reward"]` and prints them
  on the log line when `use_intrinsic_reward`. Use the two curves to diagnose
  per-seed divergence: a failing trial with high sustained intrinsic but flat
  extrinsic is farming graph novelty (reward hacking) rather than just unlucky
  exploration.

### Visualizing the coordination graphs

`algorithms/tests/visualize_coordination_graph.py` runs one deterministic
episode with a trained policy and plots, at evenly spaced snapshot timesteps,
the env frame next to the critic's per-head coordination graphs. Nodes (agents)
sit on a **fixed circular layout** that carries no meaning, so the focus is the
edges: their weights are the symmetric attention adjacency read from
`network_old.critic.encoder` under `no_grad`, mapped to both color (shared
viridis colorbar over all heads/snapshots) and line width. `--show-labels`
annotates each edge with its weight; `--edge-threshold` hides weak edges. Frames
are captured headlessly via the pygame dummy SDL driver. Defaults target the
`cg_team_novelty` trial-2 model; run with:

```
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy python -m algorithms.tests.visualize_coordination_graph \
    [--model ...pth] [--config ...yaml] [--env _env.yaml] \
    [--seed N] [--snapshots K] [--edge-threshold T] [--show-labels] [--out fig.png]
```

Plan: `plans/coordination_graph_novelty.md`.

## Hierarchical macro-action controller (`algorithms/hierarchical/`)

A high-level policy that, instead of emitting low-level forces, **selects which
of 4 frozen pre-trained skills to run** as a fixed-duration macro-action. The
controller is trained with the ordinary MAPPO stack — the trick is a gym wrapper
that makes "pick a skill, run it for K steps" look like one discrete env step.

- **Skills** (`skills.py`). A skill is a frozen, eval-mode `MAPPOActor`. The 4
  box2d tasks share `ObservationManager`, so every skill actor takes the same
  `obs_dim=40` local obs and emits the same `action_dim=2` force; only their
  critics differ (unused — we run actors only). `load_skill_actor` reads
  `checkpoint["network"]`, keeps the `"actor."`-prefixed keys (strip one prefix:
  `actor.actor.0.weight -> actor.0.weight`) and loads them into a fresh
  `MAPPOActor`. **Architecture (in/hidden/out) is inferred from the weights, not
  the yaml** — the pre-trained `mlp_shared` actors use hidden=183, not
  `Model_Params.hidden_dim=168`. `SKILL_ORDER = [contact, scatter, push_box,
  rendezvouz]` fixes the discrete action index → skill mapping;
  `resolve_skill_checkpoint` prefers `models_finished.pth`, falling back to
  `models_checkpoint.pth` (e.g. `scatter_9a` only ships the checkpoint).
- **Wrapper** (`hrl_env.py`). `HierarchicalSkillEnv(gym.Env)` builds a base env
  via the shared `make_single_env` factory and loads the 4 skills once.
  `decision_scope`:
  - `"agent"`: each agent picks its own skill. Obs `(n_agents, 40)`, action
    `MultiDiscrete([4]*n_agents)`.
  - `"team"`: one skill for all agents. Obs `(1, n_agents*40)` (flattened team
    state), action `MultiDiscrete([4])` → a single high-level agent.
  Each `step` runs the chosen skill(s) for `macro_len` (default 10) low-level
  steps — agents sharing a skill are batched through that actor in one forward —
  accumulating reward and stopping early on done. `torch.set_num_threads(1)` per
  worker.
- **Wiring.** `EnvironmentEnum.HRL_SKILL = "hrl_skill"`; `make_single_env`
  (factored out of `make_vec_env`'s closure so the wrapper can reuse it) builds
  the wrapper. `make_vec_env` launches HRL workers with the **`forkserver`** MP
  start method — the default `fork` deadlocks when each worker `torch.load`s
  models (inherited OpenMP/thread state); other envs keep `fork`. `forkserver`
  re-imports the entry module, so HRL training **must** be launched under an
  `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard (Hydra's `train.py` already is).
  `vec_trainer` adds `HRL_SKILL` to its discrete list and derives the *learning*
  agent count from `obs_space.shape[0]` (1 for team scope, n_agents otherwise) —
  behavior-preserving for normal envs where that equals `env_params["n_agents"]`.
- **Config.** Batches `experiments/yamls/hrl_{agent,team}_multi_box_push_9a/`
  carry the macro knobs in the `_batch.yaml` `env:` block (`base_environment`,
  `decision_scope`, `macro_len`, `skill_experiment`, `skill_trial`); the
  `mlp_shared.yaml` is a standard discrete-MAPPO config. Once migrated into
  `conf/` (`conf/env/hrl_agent_multi_box_push_9a.yaml` + the model file), run with:
  ```
  uv run python train.py env=hrl_agent_multi_box_push_9a model=mlp_shared \
      algorithm=mappo trial_id=0
  ```
- **Skill-selection logging.** `RolloutCollector` tallies the chosen discrete
  actions over each rollout (`np.bincount`) and returns a normalized
  `action_distribution` on `RolloutResult`; `vec_trainer` records it into
  `training_stats["action_distribution"]` (one fractions-vector per iteration,
  recorded only for discrete runs) and prints it on the log line — labeled with
  `SKILL_ORDER` names for HRL (`Skills: contact=0.19 scatter=0.25 ...`) via
  `_format_action_distribution`. Use it to watch the controller specialize off a
  uniform `1/n` split. Generic to any discrete env (shown as `Actions: i:p`).
- Plan: `plans/now-i-want-you-wise-graham.md`.

## Hypergraph backend: `dhg` shim (`hypergraphs/hg_compat.py`)

The upstream `dhg` (DeepHypergraph) package pins `torch<2`, which blocked
upgrading PyTorch. The runtime only ever used `dhg` as a thin container that
turns `(num_v, edge_list)` into the sparse incidence matrices `H` / `H_T` — the
HGNN smoothing math is already reimplemented in
`hypergraphs/hgnn_conv_layer.py:smoothing_with_hgnn_factors`. So `dhg` was
replaced by a small drop-in shim, `hypergraphs/hg_compat.py`, imported
everywhere as `import hypergraphs.hg_compat as dhg`.

- Implements exactly the surface the code consumes: `dhg.Hypergraph(num_v,
  e_list, device=...)` with `.H`, `.H_T`, `.num_e`, `.num_v`, `.device`,
  `.to(device)`, `.e`, `.draw(...)`, plus `dhg.random.hypergraph_Gnm` /
  `graph_Gnm` (demo/test helpers).
- Semantics matched against `dhg` 0.9.x and verified numerically (incidence
  `H @ Hᵀ`, HGNN smoothing output, and structural-entropy edge-size multiset
  all equal): `H` is `(num_v, num_e)` float32 with unit entries; identical
  hyperedges (order-independent) are merged so `num_e` counts unique edges;
  duplicate vertices within an edge accumulate. Edge/column ordering is not
  guaranteed to match dhg's (irrelevant to every consumer — smoothing is
  `H Hᵀ`, entropy is permutation-invariant).
- `.draw()` is best-effort matplotlib (circular node layout, hyperedges as
  blobs/lines/rings), not pixel-faithful to dhg's renderer; it raises
  `ValueError` on an empty hypergraph like dhg (the renderer catches that).
- `dhg` is removed from `pyproject.toml` and `torch` is now `>=2.0`.
- NOT ported: `hypergraphs/hypegraph_training.py`, a standalone Cora/GCN demo
  that uses `dhg.models.GCN` / `dhg.data.Cora` / `dhg.metrics`. It is not part
  of the MAPPO runtime and still requires the real `dhg` to run.

## DCG coordination-graph algorithm (`algorithms/dcg/`)

DCG (Deep Coordination Graph, Böhmer et al. 2020) is integrated as a first-class
algorithm alongside MAPPO/IPPO: launch it with `train.py algorithm=dcg`
(`AlgorithmEnum.DCG`, dispatched in `algorithms/algorithms.py`). Unlike MAPPO's
on-policy vectorized PPO, DCG is **off-policy episodic Q-learning** — RNN feature
agents → per-agent utility `f_i` and per-edge payoff `f_ij` nets → max-sum
message passing over a coordination graph → double-Q TD targets from an episode
replay buffer.

- **Vendored core + adapter.** The upstream PyMARL project lives unmodified
  under `algorithms/dcg/src` (controller `controllers/dcg_controller.py`,
  learner `learners/dcg_learner.py`, `components/episode_buffer.py`, action
  selectors, `modules/agents/rnn_feature_agent.py`, mixers). The framework
  adapter wraps it: `types.py` (dataclasses `DCG_Params` / `DCG_Model_Params` /
  `Experiment`), `args_builder.py` (translates the dataclasses + env dims into
  the flat `args` namespace the vendored modules read — the single config
  bridge), `logger_shim.py` (a `log_stat`/`console_logger` stand-in for Sacred),
  `trainer.py` (`DCGTrainer`), and `run.py` (`DCG_Runner(Runner)`). `_vendor.py`
  puts `src/` on `sys.path` so `from controllers.dcg_controller import ...`
  resolves (no repo-root name collisions). The `controllers/__init__.py` and
  `learners/__init__.py` registries were trimmed to the DCG stack; the alt
  controllers/learners (`cg_mac`, `low_rank_q`, `coma`, `qtran`) are still
  vendored but unregistered (out of scope, and some need `torch_scatter`).
- **Discrete envs only.** DCG requires a `MultiDiscrete` action space +
  available-action masks. It targets the SMAC-style envs (`smaclite`,
  `smacv2`), whose gym wrappers already surface `info["avail_actions"]`
  `(n_envs, n_agents, n_actions)`. Continuous box2d envs are unsupported
  (`DCGTrainer.__init__` raises on a non-discrete action space). Global state is
  the concatenation of per-agent obs (`obs_dim * n_agents`), matching MAPPO;
  only the optional duelling bias / mixers consume it.
- **`torch_scatter` removed.** `dcg_controller.py`'s 3 `scatter_add` sites now
  use a native-torch `_scatter_add` helper (`out.scatter_add_` with a broadcast
  index), dropping the compiled, version-pinned dependency — same motivation as
  the `dhg` shim. Verified numerically against a reference. The vendored
  `episode_buffer._parse_slices` now returns a tuple (torch>=2 deprecates
  list-of-slices tensor indexing).
- **Collection loop** (`DCGTrainer._collect`) replaces PyMARL's
  `parallel_runner`: it drives a gym `AsyncVectorEnv` (built by the shared
  `make_vec_env`) in lockstep, packing transitions into DCG's `EpisodeBatch`
  (shape `(n_envs, episode_limit+1)`). Each env is **frozen on its first
  done**; the stored `terminated` field is the gym `terminated` flag only, so a
  time-limit `truncated` keeps `terminated=0` and its TD target still bootstraps
  (PyMARL semantics). Under Gymnasium's default `NEXT_STEP` autoreset the
  terminal observation is returned at the done step, so the stored next state is
  correct. Frozen envs still get stepped (the vector API requires it) with a
  valid fallback action (`cur_avail.argmax`) — a dummy `0` would be an illegal
  action once a frozen env auto-resets into a fresh live episode.
- **Checkpoint / stats.** `save_agent`/`load_agent` write a single `.pth`
  (agent + utility/payoff nets + optimiser + RNG) as `models_finished.pth` /
  `models_checkpoint.pth`; `_StatsBook` pickles `training_stats_*.pkl`.
  `checkpoint=true` resumes from the last saved step (verified).
- **Config.** Ported into `conf/`: `conf/algorithm/dcg.yaml` (`params`),
  `conf/model/dcg.yaml` (`model_params`), `conf/env/dcg_smaclite_2s3z.yaml`
  (`env:` block — `environment`/`n_agents`/`env_variant`). Source material stays
  at `experiments/yamls/dcg_smaclite_2s3z/` (`_batch.yaml`, `dcg.yaml`, and the
  tiny fast-run `dcg_test.yaml`). Launch:
  ```
  uv run python train.py env=dcg_smaclite_2s3z model=dcg algorithm=dcg trial_id=0
  ```

## DCG over macro-actions (`algorithms/dcg_macro/`)

`dcg_macro` (`AlgorithmEnum.DCG_MACRO = "dcg_macro"`) runs the **unmodified DCG
core** over the hierarchical macro-action interface, so DCG's discrete
coordination-graph Q-learning drives a continuous box2d task (e.g.
`multi_box_push`) by **selecting frozen skills** instead of low-level forces. It
is the DCG analogue of the hierarchical MAPPO controller.

- **No DCG code change; the env supplies the macro mechanism.** DCG needs a
  `MultiDiscrete` action space, which `HierarchicalSkillEnv`
  (`algorithms/hierarchical/hrl_env.py`) already provides: the discrete action
  picks one of 4 frozen skills (`SKILL_ORDER`) and runs it for `macro_len`
  low-level steps. So `dcg_macro` is a **thin package** — `algorithms/dcg_macro/
  run.py` defines `DCG_Runner` but imports the trainer/types straight from
  `algorithms.dcg` (`from algorithms.dcg.trainer import DCGTrainer`); the vendored
  PyMARL core is reused, not duplicated. (The rest of the `algorithms/dcg_macro/`
  copy — `trainer.py`/`args_builder.py`/`src/` etc. — is currently unused dead
  weight; delete if the package need not diverge from `dcg`.)
- **Wiring.** `algorithms/types.py` adds the enum; `algorithms/algorithms.py`
  `_dispatch` adds a `case AlgorithmEnum.DCG_MACRO` mirroring `DCG` but importing
  `algorithms.dcg_macro.run.DCG_Runner` (and reusing `algorithms.dcg.types.
  Experiment`). `make_vec_env` already pins the `forkserver` start method for
  `HRL_SKILL` (each worker `torch.load`s the skill actors), so DCG's two vec
  envs build correctly. The box2d/HRL envs surface no `info["avail_actions"]`, so
  DCG's `_get_avail` falls back to an all-ones mask — correct, since all 4 skills
  are always selectable.
- **Config.** `conf/algorithm/dcg_macro.yaml` (`params`, same as `dcg` but with
  `episode_limit: 200` ≥ the ~103 macro-steps of a 1024-step base env at
  `macro_len=10`), `conf/model/dcg_macro.yaml` (DCG `model_params`, verbatim from
  `dcg`), and `conf/env/dcg_macro_multi_box_push_9a.yaml` — the HRL-wrapped env
  block: `environment: hrl_skill` (DCG reads this), `base_environment:
  multi_box_push`, `decision_scope: agent` (each of 9 agents picks a skill →
  9-node coordination graph, `MultiDiscrete([4]*9)`, obs `(9, 40)`), `macro_len`,
  `skill_experiment: mlp_shared`, `skill_trial: "0"`. The 4 skills load from
  `experiments/results/{contact,scatter,push_box,rendezvouz}_9a/mlp_shared/0/`.
  Launch:
  ```
  uv run python train.py env=dcg_macro_multi_box_push_9a model=dcg_macro \
      algorithm=dcg_macro trial_id=0
  ```

## Oracle difference rewards (`algorithms/difference_rewards/`)

A measurement stack (not wired into training) for computing **exact** difference
rewards `D_i = G(z) - G(z_-i + c_i)` by forking the pure functional MJX env.

**Status:** the research direction it was built for — *difference rewards under
asynchronous macro-actions* — was explored and **abandoned as tautological** (an
estimator fed a knowingly-wrong commitment state produces wrong credit; and the
non-tautological rescue, an async-specific counterfactual-scope ambiguity, was
measured and falsified: sync 0.626 vs async 0.680 cross-horizon stability). See
`plans/async_difference_rewards.md`. The **oracle itself is the reusable asset** and
does not depend on asynchrony: it enables auditing what learned counterfactual
baselines (vendored COMA, `algorithms/mappo/hg_cache.py:414`) actually recover —
normally uncheckable, since most envs cannot rewind.

- **`environments/mjx_suite/macro_skills.py`** — 4 scripted, deterministic JAX skills
  (`SKILL_ORDER = [contact, push, scatter, rendezvous]`, index = discrete action) plus
  `null_action`, the counterfactual default `c_i` (not policy-selectable). Skills are
  scripted rather than the frozen torch actors of `algorithms/hierarchical/skills.py`:
  being deterministic they make the forked counterfactual exact. **They sense only
  within `env.sector_sensor_radius`** — a global centroid gives a distant, physically
  irrelevant agent a causal channel into every teammate and manufactures false credit.
  `skill_scatter` carries `_wall_repulsion`; without it agents walk into the boundary,
  which `MultiBoxPushMJX` terminates with zero reward.
- **`environments/mjx_suite/macro_wrapper.py`** — `AsyncMacroMJX` + `MacroState`
  (`EnvState` + per-agent `skill_idx`/`elapsed`/`remaining`), pure and jit/vmap-able.
  One `step` is one **low-level** step: the policy is queried every step but only
  agents whose commitment expired adopt the proposed skill, so decision points
  decouple while shapes stay static. Obs = `MACRO_OBS_DIM` (the shared 40-dim `OBS_DIM`
  + one-hot skill + remaining/elapsed). Conditions: `d_min == d_max, stagger=False`
  reproduces the `HierarchicalSkillEnv` lockstep exactly (the control); `stagger=True`
  offsets phases; `d_min < d_max` varies durations. `commit`/`step_committed` are split
  out so the oracle can fork *after* commitment.
- **`algorithms/difference_rewards/oracle.py`** — exact `D_i` by **forking the
  simulator** (`MultiBoxPushMJX` is pure, so a state can be replayed under a
  counterfactual — no learned model, unlike COMA/Dr.Reinforce). One vmap over
  `[-1, 0..A-1]` runs the factual + every counterfactual in one compiled call under
  **common random numbers**. `aligned_belief` collapses commitment phase to the joint
  mean = the synchronous estimator's belief. Two invariants that are easy to get
  wrong: the counterfactual rollout **must let agents re-decide** (frozen skills make
  `remaining`/`elapsed` inert and the sync/async estimators coincide identically), and
  `aligned_belief` must collapse to the **mean** phase, not reset to nominal `L`, or
  the control shows spurious bias.
- **`algorithms/difference_rewards/bias_study.py`** — the (abandoned) falsification,
  no training. Compares `D_oracle` vs `D_sync` from the same physical state under the
  same rollout key. Result: sync estimator exact under synchrony (pearson 1.0, bias
  0.0), collapses under any asynchrony (pearson ~0.3, `norm_bias ~1.0`, sign wrong
  ~25%) — but this is **near-tautological**, see the status note above. Two reusable
  methodology points survive: compute metrics **per state then aggregate** (credit
  scale varies ~100x across states, so pooled ratios are meaningless — a first attempt
  produced a garbage `norm_bias=29.9` from a small denominator), and measure only at
  **engaged** states (at reset every `D_i` is 0, so attribution tests pass vacuously —
  the first verification run was a false pass for exactly this reason).
