Whenever building new code, try to reuse as much code as possible. If the new functionality overlaps heavily with other parts of the code, find a way to abstract and reuse the logic instead of duplicating the functionality.

Always keep the CLAUDE.md file up to date to reflect the current functionality and architecture of the code.

## Box2D suite observations

All `environments/box2d_suite` envs share `ObservationManager.get_observation`
(in `observation.py`). The per-agent observation vector is, in order:

- `own_velocity` (2) — linear velocity normalized by `velocity_norm`
- `density_sensors` (16) — 8-sector centroid distance to agents (0-7) and objects (8-15)
- `is_touching_object` (1)
- `neighbor_fraction` (1) — fraction of agents within `neighbor_detection_range` (incl. self)
- `contact_force` (1) — per-agent contact force / `force_multiplier`
- `lidar` (`N_LIDAR_RAYS`, default 16) — nearest-obstacle distance along evenly
  spaced world-frame rays via Box2D raycast; normalized to [0, 1], 1.0 == clear

The total dimension is exported as `OBS_DIM` (= `BASE_OBS_DIM + N_LIDAR_RAYS`) from
`observation.py`; every env's `observation_space` must use `OBS_DIM` so the layout
stays in sync. Per-env overrides `n_lidar_rays` / `lidar_range` are read via
`getattr` (defaults: `N_LIDAR_RAYS`, `sector_sensor_radius`).

## Coordination-graph novelty exploration (gnn critic)

When `critic_type="gnn"`, the `AttentionGNNCritic` (`networks/gnn_critic.py`)
emits a per-head coordination graph from its attention encoder. Setting
`use_intrinsic_reward=True` (in `Model_Params`) turns that graph into an
exploration bonus: agents are rewarded for reaching states whose **coordination
graph is novel** within the current episode.

- The encoder is **dual-purpose** — shared with the value path and trained by the
  value loss, so the graph is grounded. The bonus reads it under `no_grad` via
  `network_old` (`MAPPOAgent.compute_coordination_features`).
- Descriptor (`AttentionGNNCritic.coordination_descriptor`, exposed via
  `MAPPONetwork.coordination_descriptor`):
  - `intrinsic_reward_mode="team"` → upper-triangle of each head's adjacency,
    one bonus per env tiled to all agents.
  - `intrinsic_reward_mode="agent"` → each agent's coordination row across heads,
    a per-agent bonus.
  - `intrinsic_descriptor_source` is `"adjacency"` (graph structure, default) or
    `"node_embedding"` (attended tokens) for ablation.
- Novelty is episodic k-NN distance (`intrinsic_reward.py`,
  `BatchedIntrinsicReward`). One batched rewarder scores all streams at once —
  one stream per env (`team`) or per (env, agent) (`agent`) — using a
  preallocated ring buffer `(n_streams, capacity, feat_dim)` and a single
  `cdist`/`sort`, instead of a per-stream deque that restacked its full memory
  every step (quadratic in episode length). Streams reset on episode done.
  Reward is `log(d_k + 1)` for the `min(k, count)`-th nearest stored point;
  empty-memory/done streams score 0. Plumbed in `RolloutCollector`
  (`_get_team_intrinsic_rewards` / `_get_agent_intrinsic_rewards`) and folded into
  per-agent rewards in `MAPPOAgent.store_transitions_batch` (single-stream, scaled
  by `intrinsic_reward_coef`).
- Config knobs in `Model_Params`: `intrinsic_reward_coef`, `intrinsic_reward_k`,
  `intrinsic_reward_memory_capacity`. Asserts `critic_type=="gnn"`; fully inert
  when `use_intrinsic_reward=False`.

### Visualizing the coordination graphs

`algorithms/tests/visualize_coordination_graph.py` runs one deterministic
episode with a trained policy and plots, at evenly spaced snapshot timesteps,
the env frame next to the critic's per-head coordination graphs. Nodes (agents)
sit on a **fixed circular layout** that carries no meaning, so the focus is the
edges: their weights are the symmetric attention adjacency read from
`network_old.critic.encoder` under `no_grad`, mapped to both color (shared
viridis colorbar over all heads/snapshots) and line width. `--show-labels`
annotates each edge with its weight; `--edge-threshold` hides weak edges. Frames
are captured headlessly via the pygame dummy SDL driver. Defaults target the
`cg_team_novelty` trial-2 model; run with:

```
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy python -m algorithms.tests.visualize_coordination_graph \
    [--model ...pth] [--config ...yaml] [--env _env.yaml] \
    [--seed N] [--snapshots K] [--edge-threshold T] [--show-labels] [--out fig.png]
```
